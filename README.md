# Homework 1 - Instructions

## Step 1: Create embeddings

   (Option 1) Run file doc2vec-encoder.py
   (Option 2) Run file sentence-transformers.py

   Note: Both these files will produce two files called x_train.pkl and x_test.pkl in the root directory.

## Step 2: Make predictions

   Run file knn.py

   Note: This file will produce a prediction file in the root directory.

## Step 3 (Optional): Fine tune sentence-transformer model

   Run file fine_tune_st.py
   Run file knn.py - but make sure the model is loaded from the fine-tuned model folder in the root directory

   Note: This file will produce a file called x_train.pkl and save the model in the root directory.
